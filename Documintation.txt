USE FONT - 

200 years has passed since Alien Invasion on Earth 

Humanity managed to overcome alien thread...

With a great toll...

Alien War drained Human race and after a few decades, resources on Earth became scarced.

Humanity start to tear eachother apart, fighting over little remains of oil and Elerium.

In the end it resulted in the Third World War.

Nuclear fire purged human population even better than the aliens themselves.

Although, humanity managed to rose from the ashes yet again, more violence and crime skyrocketed, and peace enforcement became more dangerous than ever.

To prevent those types of outburst, Earth government funded many private organizations. 

You one, of them.

 ### Arcs ###

>Gang arc
Very-Very basic arc, for starting grind. You receive reports of groups of bandits around megacities that do various crimes. After innerigations of some low-ranked members you learn that they raids are orgonized and you go after more high-ranked members.

>Rebel Arc
You recive reports of groups of anarchists that distorbs goverment and corporation operations around the Wastelands (Mostly) Slowly but surely you discoverd that they are very orgonized groups of rebbels.

>Officer Tenpenny arc
After few months of your acttivety, you get contaced with one of the high-ranked MegaPol officer for more "advanced" tasks. He mostly uses and treats you like shit (shows trough random events like giving you civilian corpses and negative score penalty.) After few of those missions you get intel of his illigal activety. Digging further you find more heavy evedence of him colobiration with MarcSek (Or maybe some other corporation that makes iliggal deadly drugs ?) After getting eneough evidence and premmision of goverment, you storm his office. In the End you either kill him or arrest him  (Trugh capturing or killing in battllescape, dugh.) End of this arc give you next tech level and promotion.

Note: His entire charecter based on Officer Tenpenny from San Andreas or detective Harris form "Training day". I'm not sure if swearing or insluting player will be tolerated in Mod.oi, but who gives a shit :^)

>Corpo Arc

Evil corporation do evil things, you stop them. Simple as that.

>Syndicate Arc

Syndicate is your arch-nemesis.

>Black Sun
NAZIS IN SPACE ! You receive reports of highly trained soldiers with high-tech equipment killing inesents people and disturbing government operations. Raidning, unerground bases you learn that they main HQ located on the moon, so you go there and blow the fuckers !

>M.A.G.M.A arc
-Starts after Officer Tenpenny arc when you get more exposer and reputation.
Member of board directors of M.A.G.M.A corporation contacts you about shady stuff. Files leaks more and more, high-ranked people get killed more often and over all, M.A.G.M.A on brink of bankruptcy. So you start investigating this case. After a few solo missions (spy missions) you learn about small groups deversants that leaks info and trying to undermine the corporation. After interrigating them, you learn that they work for Solemine. The goal is to eleminate atomic energy industry and make elerium energy obsolite.

- Optional arc - give you acces to uniqe guns and armour.

You need:

a villain organzation, pulling the strings (the big bad, showing up occasionally)
various bad guys tied to them in some way (the ones you fight on a daily basis)
a sponsor (should be well written; my idea is a Clint Eastwood lookalike as a government agent)
a twist - these two forces have something in common, like some deals
a traitor (maybe Clint Eastwood?)
lots of tension

> Villain organzation. - Start form Syndicate (Kinda Like Ninjas or MiB, Well funded and always ahead of you), then Marcsec and Aliens (ONLY mentioned in text, never acted directly.)
> Various bad guys - Wasteland Raiders\Rebels\Gang Mafia\Black Sun\Hckers\Kanibals\Nomads\Corpos
> Sponsor - Intel Cheef's granddaughter from X-Files. Government babe, that took notice of you after you dealt with crooked police chief. 
> Twist - ALIENS WERE NEVER DEFEATED, AND XCOM IS THIER PUPPET!
> Traitor - Hard to tell so far, I dunno :(
> Tension - If you don't deal with those, the Earth became more of a shithole than it's allready is
