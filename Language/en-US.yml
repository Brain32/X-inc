  STR_GUNRUNNER_WORKER_UFOPEDIA: "Brute force of gunrunners. These guys are not very bright, but they are very diligent with lathe and other hardware. Usually, they are hired by various bandit factions of the Wasteland to help with production of more solid guns, unlike those that can be found in the ruins.

  STR_AUTOCOP_UFOPEDIA: "These metal wardrobes were once the best of the finest officers in Megapol. But after, um...accidents at work, their remnants were cybernized so that their skills wouldn�t be wasted. Of course, such incidents are relatively rare, because. such cybernization projects are expensive. In fact - their armor is an automated power suit, which perfectly protects against bullets and shotguns. But the excess of electronics and servos make them almost useless against Electivity and EMP waves. Serve and protect until the grave - thats their motto."
